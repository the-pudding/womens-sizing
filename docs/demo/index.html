But the more my body changed, the harder it was to find replacements in my wardrobe. Nothing fit right, the quality of products took a nosedive, and I couldn’t justify spending more money than ever before on items that would have no chance of holding up or looking good on me."

The first pair of pants I made were an absolute disaster. The fabric I used was so thick I could barely sit down without busting through the leg seams, but then it sagged so much around my backside that I looked like I was wearing an adult diaper."

With a tape measure in hand, I followed the book’s prompts to take a total of 58 individual body measurements, and from there, I could make my own custom base pattern, known as a bodice block."
