Getting started was easier than I thought. Among the many thousands of sewing patterns, tutorials, and free online resources, I found a vibrant community of seamstresses and home sewists who were eager to share their skills. The first sewing pattern I ever completed — a boxy, drop-shoulder top that came in three variations as either a shirt or dress — was free to download. It included a 29-page instruction manual with photos and illustrations documenting every step."

I had printed out more than 800 pages of step-by-step tutorials found in an outdated edition of a pattern-making textbook often taught in fashion design school. I kept everything in a canary yellow three-ring binder to serve as the curriculum for my self-guided course. With a tape measure in hand, I followed the book’s prompts to take a total of 58 individual body measurements. From there, I could make my own custom base pattern, known as a bodice block or sloper."

It didn’t matter how much weight I gained or lost, how much I contorted my body or tried to buy my way into styles that “flatter” my silhouette, there was no chance that clothes would ever be able to fit perfectly on their own. I’d always known this deep down. Many women likely feel some version of the same thing. But finally I understood why."
